===========

file-reverse should be a console app that expects a single argument. The arg is expected to be the filename of a text file. The app should read the contents of the text file and reverse the order of the words (not the characters of the word). The reversed content should then be saved to a file named the reverse of the original (with a txt extension).

"the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"

Running "file-reverse.exe fox.txt" will create a file called xof.txt with the following content:
"dog lazy the over jumps fox brown quick the"
